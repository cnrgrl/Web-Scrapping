However, I could not fully understand some Corona measures, such as the fact that the father-to-be, who comes from the same household, is only allowed to come in at the very end despite negative tests and has to leave shortly after the birth. Also, I cannot quite understand why there is currently no family room (the father is tested before entering the delivery room anyway).

Die Krankenschwestern waren sehr höflich und ich wurde medizinisch (soweit ich als Laie das ermessen kann) sehr gut betreut.

Für eine Frau, die 10 Jahre Leidensweg hinter sich hat und auch für alle anderen eine völlig unpassende Frage. Vorgespräch und OP wurden von zwei verschiedenen Ärzten gemacht. OP-Bericht laut zwei Gynäkologen nicht aussagekräftig. Endometriosezentrum kann dadurch nicht einschätzen, wie umfangreich Sanierung werden wird. Vorhandene Herde wurden nicht entfernt, zweite OP notwendig. Fazit: OP in diesem KH überflüssig. Schuld liegt aber auch bei der FÄ, die mich dorthin überwiesen hat. OP-Schwester hat mir 10 Minuten ihr Leid geklagt (\"Brauche Kaffee. Bin heute schwach. Sie haben ja wirklich schlechte Venen.\") Zugang musste zweimal gelegt werden, weil sie es nicht hinbekommen hat. Añästhesist war sehr nett und kompetent.
